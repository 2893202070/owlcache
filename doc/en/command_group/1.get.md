# The cluster obtains the Key value.
>Suppose there are now three owlcache services: 127.0.0.1: 7721, 127.0.0.1:7723, 127.0.0.1:7725. Each service has a data called Key called hello.

Each node data is independent. The data of the duplicate key in the cluster will not be deleted (the default cluster mode of owlcache). When querying, it will get a list of data sorted according to time, and the latest data will be displayed first.
